Customer Behavior Analysis

Project Overview: Customer Feedback & Purchase Behavior Analysis â€“ ShopEasy

In this project, I conducted an in-depth data analysis for ShopEasy, focusing on customer feedback, product reviews, and purchasing behavior to support marketing and customer experience optimization.

Using Python (Pandas, Numpy) and SQL:

- Analyzed customer sentiment from reviews and ratings  
- Identified key complaints and improvement areas by categorizing feedback  
- Detected patterns between negative reviews and product performance  
- Provided data-driven strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and retention 
- Created a detailed PowerPoint presentation to summarize insights and actionable recommendations  

This analysis serves as a blueprint for improving product quality, refining marketing strategies, and boosting overall customer engagement and loyalty.
